# Hi, I'm Sangmin (Sandy)!

I'm a data analyst passionate about uncovering insights, solving user and business challenges, and driving measurable impact across product, strategy, and operations. I'm currently completing my Master's in Computational Social Science at UC Berkeley, where I focus on applying data analytics, machine learning, and data storytelling to solve real-world problems.

My background spans both private and public sectors. Before grad school, I worked as a Business Analyst at the world's 3rd busiest international airport, where I used SQL to analyze large-scale transportation and customer datasets, forecasted demand, and built 50+ Tableau dashboards to support real-time operational and marketing strategies. These insights led to the launch of new flight routes and the optimization of terminal resource allocation.

At Berkeley, I was trained to own the full analytics lifecycle, from data engineering and modeling to deployment and insight delivery. I've built applied, end-to-end solutions in collaboration with multiple partners.
Most recently, I partnered with FocusKPI, a data analytics consulting firm, to develop an AI-powered app review pipeline and dashboard that revealed churn drivers from 10k+ app reviews. The tool helped product teams prioritize feature improvements and shape product roadmaps based on user insights. 
For my capstone, I partnered with the Berkeley Police Department to build a GIS-based patrol zone optimization tool adopted by the Office of Strategic Planning to improve workload equity and evidence-based deployment. 
In both projects, I built scalable pipelines to extract, clean, and analyze data, designed custom metrics and prioritization frameworks and delivered insights through self-serve dashboards that empowered non-technical stakeholders to make data-informed decisions, making complex analysis accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

Through rigorous coursework and applied research, I've also developed strong technical capabilities at the intersection of data science and social impact. At MaCSS, I've contributed to research projects that advance data-driven policymaking in California, including:
- Developing a displacement risk index for Bay Area census tracts by integrating ACS and eviction data to identify high-risk communities and inform housing policy.
- Measuring gender disparities in the workforce by analyzing national education and earnings data to uncover structural inequities and support equity-driven interventions.
- Evaluating the impact of Twitter's deplatforming on misinformation diffusion using causal inference methods to inform content moderation and policy design.

Ultimately, I'm drawn to roles where I can apply technical rigor to high-impact problems—whether that's improving products and user experiences in the tech industry, or driving data-informed decisions in public policy settings. With experience working across both domains, I bring a unique ability to translate complex data into actionable insights that serve people, improve systems, and guide strategic decisions.

## Work

I feel most fulfilled when developing impactful solutions to real-world problems or when exploring innovative technologies.

At FocusKPI, I partnered with a leading analytics consultancy to build an AI-powered app review analysis pipeline that processed and tagged over 10,000 reviews by sentiment, topic, and product issue. Leveraging techniques such as prompt engineering with GPT-4o and short-text semantic grouping, I engineered an end-to-end system that surfaced key churn drivers and powered an interactive Streamlit dashboard for product teams. I also developed automated reporting logic to rank user issues by estimated revenue risk, enabling product teams to prioritize features and shape data-driven roadmap decisions. The project was showcased at a final Demo Day, highlighting its value to stakeholders and demonstrating its potential for real-world impact.

At the Berkeley Police Department, I led the development of a GIS-based patrol zone optimization tool that analyzed 60,000+ service calls to uncover workload imbalances and recommend data-driven boundary redesigns. Using Python, GeoPandas, and Shapely, I engineered geospatial algorithms that integrated response time, call priority, and disposition data into a normalized Police Patrol Workload Score (PPWS), enabling more equitable resource allocation across patrol sectors.
I built interactive heatmaps and sector-level dashboards with custom KPIs to visualize workload distribution and highlight high-priority hotspots. The tool produced year-over-year comparison maps and scenario testing outputs, which were adopted by the Office of Strategic Planning to guide annual patrol updates. This project not only improved workload equity by 15% but also established a replicable framework for operational decision-making through geospatial analytics.

At Incheon International Airport Corporation, I worked as a Business Analyst supporting airline marketing and international route development strategy for the world's 3rd busiest airport.  I used SQL to pull and analyze large traffic datasets and delivered KPI reports to senior leadership, enabling data-informed decisions across aviation marketing, airline partnerships, and new route planning. 
I also designed and maintained 50+ Tableau and Excel dashboards to monitor performance metrics, market trends, and campaign effectiveness in real time. My analysis informed strategic decisions for Incheon's New Routes Incubating Program, which provided targeted marketing incentives to transition irregular flights into regular routes. 
By analyzing airline traffic patterns, competitor capacity, and market segmentation, I identified new revenue opportunities and supported strategic outreach, contributing to a 7% increase in APAC market share.
